The Test Desiderata desires 12 properties for tests, two of which are:

- Isolation—the result of running one test should be completely independent of the results of other tests.
- Composition—??? tests should run together??? Isn’t that the same thing as isolation?

No, and here’s why (I finally got an example—examples are always the hardest part.)

## Isolation

If a test runs by first setting up its own test fixture, creating from scratch all the data it will be using as input, then that test is guaranteed to be *isolated*. It doesn’t matter what order you run the tests, the results will be exactly the same. (This is the same property as referential transparency in functional programming.)

Isolation is encouraged in the xUnit testing frameworks (at least most of them) by creating a new instance of a test object for every test & running the setUp() function before running the test. (Some frameworks, notably NUnit, reuse test instances, opening the door to breaking isolation.)

## Composition

Say we have a suite of isolated tests & we run them all together. The suite’s success should give us confidence (be *predictive* in Desiderata terms), even though each individual test on its own isn’t comprehensive.

Example—say we have a test:

`test1()     object := new Whatever()     actual := object.doSomething()     assertEquals(expected, actual)`

We get that working so we want to implement the next bit of functionality. We copy, paste, & extend:

`test2()     object := new Whatever()     actual := object.doSomething()     assertEquals(expected, actual)     actual2 := object.nowSomethingElse()     assertEquals(expected2, actual2)`

I have seen tests like this that have been copied, pasted, & extended 6 or 7 times. That last test is pretty hard to read.

Notice that test2 can’t pass if test1 fails. All non-compliant programs caught by test1 will also be caught by test2. We have at least 3 options that preserve the same coverage, the same predictability:

- Leave both tests.
- Delete test1.
- Simplify test2.

## Pruning

From a purely aesthetic standpoint (& don’t discount aesthetics), leaving both tests as is offends my sensibilities. They are redundant! Something *must* be wrong.

Deleting test1 loses us another property from the Test Desiderata—tests should be *specific*. That’s the property of tests where, when one fails, you know exactly where the problem is.

Which leads to my preferred solution—composition. I trim test2 to avoid the purely redundant parts:

`test2()     object := new Whatever()     object.doSomething()     actual := object.nowSomethingElse()     assertEquals(expected, actual)`

The composition of test1 + test2 hasn’t lost any of the predictive property. It hasn’t lost any of the specific property. In fact the composition may be more specific as it is possible for test1 to fail & test2 to pass (although they may both fail for a common reason).

## N x M

Let’s say we have 4 ways of computing interest & 5 ways of reporting that interest. The brute force approach to testing this is 20 tests. Using composition, though, we can achieve the same confidence in our system with 10 tests. If the variants of computing interest are separated, in a functional programming sense, from the variants of reporting, then we need:

- 4 tests for computation
- 5 tests for reporting
- 1 test that combines computing & reporting, to demonstrate that they are wired together

Gaining confidence from composed tests requires some thought, some inference, some design (to make the orthogonal dimensions demonstrably orthogonal), but the investment in writing pays off in making tests:

- Faster
- More readable
- Easier to change
- More specific
- Less sensitive to structure changes

## Critique

When I’ve explained what I mean by composable tests, I often receive shocked reactions from experienced testing-developers. “I would *never* reduce the assertions in a test.” This seems to me to be a reaction based in fear, not in principle. We worked *so hard* to get to write tests at all. We can’t make them *worse*.

Composition isn’t making tests worse. Composition is looking at the tests as a whole, trying to make the whole better as judged by several valuable properties of tests.
